I used GitHub Copilot and Gemini CLI to build a simple Ping-Pong game in Python, and the experience with each tool felt quite different. With GitHub Copilot, the game was built using the pygame library, which resulted in a fully graphical window with smooth movement, clear paddles, a ball, and a visible scoreboard. This made the game feel more complete and closer to a real Pong game. The code was easy to read and follow, especially for someone familiar with Python, and it was quick to go from idea to a working prototype. However, the code was mostly written in one main loop, which works for small projects but could be harder to maintain or extend for a larger game.
On the other hand, the Gemini CLI generated a terminal-based version of the game using the curses library. This version was simpler and more lightweight, running entirely in the command line using text characters for the paddles and ball. While it did not look as visually appealing as the pygame version, the code was better structured, with the main logic organized inside a function and a clear winning condition. It also included basic error handling and was easy to modify for rule changes. That said, debugging and running the game can be a bit trickier, especially since curses does not work well on all operating systems, particularly Windows.
Overall, GitHub Copilot felt more suitable for quickly creating a visually engaging game, while Gemini CLI was better for building a simple, structured prototype with minimal setup. Both tools were effective, but they supported different styles of development and learning.
